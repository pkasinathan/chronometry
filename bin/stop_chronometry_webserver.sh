# Chronometry Web Server Shutdown Script
################################################################################
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Gracefully stops the Chronometry web server running on port 8051,
#   allowing active connections to complete before shutdown.
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   1. Finds running web_server.py process
#   2. Sends SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
#   3. Waits up to 10 seconds for clean exit
#   4. Force kills (SIGKILL) if necessary
#   5. Verifies port 8051 is released
#
# SHUTDOWN BEHAVIOR:
#   - Graceful (SIGTERM): Completes active requests, closes connections
#   - Forced (SIGKILL): Immediate termination after timeout
#   - Timeout: 10 seconds before force kill
#
# USAGE:
#   ./stop_chronometry_webserver.sh
#
# ALTERNATIVE:
#   If running in foreground: Press Ctrl+C
#
# WHAT HAPPENS DURING SHUTDOWN:
#   1. Active HTTP requests complete
#   2. WebSocket connections close gracefully
#   3. Flask server shuts down cleanly
#   4. Port 8051 is released
#   5. Process exits
#
# FILES AFFECTED:
#   - Preserves: All data files (frames, annotations, digests, timelines)
#   - Preserves: Log files (if redirected)
#   - Preserves: config.yaml
#   - No PID file created by default (unless manually created)
#
# PORT:
#   8051 - Web server port (verified after shutdown)
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 - Web server stopped successfully
#   1 - Web server not running or error occurred
#
# VERIFICATION:
#   After running, verify with:
#   ps aux | grep web_server.py   # Should return nothing
#   lsof -i :8051                  # Should return nothing (port released)
#   curl http://localhost:8051     # Should fail to connect
#
# NOTES:
#   - Safe to run multiple times
#   - Does not affect menu bar app or main agent
#   - Does not affect captured data
#   - Can restart immediately after stopping
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
#   - "Not running" error: Web server already stopped
#   - Port still in use: Another process may have claimed it
#   - Force kill triggered: Check logs for stuck requests
#   - Can't connect after restart: Check port conflicts
#
# TO RESTART:
#   ./stop_chronometry_webserver.sh
#   ./start_chronometry_webserver.sh
#
# BACKGROUND OPERATION:
#   If web server was started in background:
#   - This script will find and stop it
#   - No need to track PID manually
#   - Automatically cleans up background process
