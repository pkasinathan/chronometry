    You are annotating MY OWN work activity from 1–6 screenshots captured within a short time window. Write what I’m actually doing and why — not what the UI looks like.

    ✦ Voice & POV
      - Write in first person (“I am …”), concise, professional.
      - Prefer action + purpose: what I’m doing → why → expected outcome/next step.

    ✦ Evidence to extract (from PR/IDE/terminal/docs/Slack/Jira/UIs)
      - Repository, branch, PR/MR number & title, author, reviewers, status (open/draft/merged), target branch.
      - Ticket/issue IDs (JIRA/Linear), code module/file/function names, tests, datasets, workflow names.
      - Commands run, errors, CI status, environment (dev/test/prod), time ranges.
      - From IDE/Cursor right panel: current task, instruction, diff summary, test results.
      - From PR: what’s being changed and for what purpose (summarize in 1 short clause).

    ✦ Classification (choose one): {coding, code review, debugging, data analysis, documentation, meeting, planning, ops/monitoring, admin}
      - If meeting/video call is active, summarize meeting purpose/topic; no screen details.

    ✦ Multi-frame rule
      - Treat the most recent frame as primary. Use nearby frames only to firm up intent (e.g., commit → tests → PR).

    ✦ Output format (keep it tight; no UI description)
      **Title (12 words max): strong verb + object + purpose**
        - Activity: 1–2 sentences in first person stating what/why/outcome.
        - Artifacts: repo, branch, PR/issue IDs, files/modules (if visible).
        - Status/Next: current status and the next concrete step.
        - Category: {coding, code review, debugging, data analysis, documentation, meeting, planning, ops/monitoring, admin}
        - Confidence: 0–100% (mark "inferred" where you had to infer)

    ✦ Style constraints
      - Do NOT describe layout, colors, or widget positions.
      - Prefer “Reviewing PR #123 by Deepthi to add hourly digest; verifying unit tests pass before merge” over generic “GitHub PR page visible”.
      - If author names (e.g., Deepthi, Prabhu) appear, include them. If unsure, say “(inferred)”.

    If signal is insufficient: state the most likely work action + “(low confidence; limited context)”.
  rewrite_screenshot_analysis_format_summary: true
  rewrite_screenshot_analysis_prompt: |
    You are formatting a work activity summary that may contain multiple distinct activities.

    YOUR TASK:
    1. Identify distinct activities (separated by blank lines or context shifts)
    2. For EACH activity, format with a bold title followed by indented bullet points
    3. Add proper markdown spacing (blank line between activities)
    4. Keep all factual details (repo names, PR numbers, file paths, commits, etc.)
    5. Remove any redundancy within each activity description
    6. Ensure consistent first-person voice

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Each activity should follow this structure:
    **Title (12 words max): strong verb + object + purpose**
      - Activity: 1–2 sentences in first person stating what/why/outcome.
      - Artifacts: repo, branch, PR/issue IDs, files/modules (if visible).
      - Status/Next: current status and the next concrete step.
      - Category: {coding, code review, debugging, data analysis, documentation, meeting, planning, ops/monitoring, admin}
      - Confidence: 0–100% (mark inferred where you had to infer)

    [blank line between activities]
